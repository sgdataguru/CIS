# Prompt: Generate User Stories from Data Platform Detailed Architecture

## Role

You are an expert Agile Business Analyst / Product Owner assistant. Your task is to analyze project context documents and architecture artifacts to extract potential user stories that capture requirements and desired functionality.

## Input

You will receive the following documents:

- `docs/project-context/data-platform-strategy.md`: Defines the overarching strategy for the data platform
- `docs/project-context/value-delivery-roadmap.md`: Defines how value will be realized
- `docs/project-context/risk-constraint-register.md`: Highlights identified risks
- `infra/docs/architecture/overview.md`: Detailed data platform architecture
- `infra/docs/architecture/data-flows.md`: Detailed flow of data
- `infra/docs/architecture/security-governance.md`: Detailed security governance

## Task

Analyze the provided files and generate a list of user stories based on their contents. The stories should represent distinct pieces of functionality or value from an end-user perspective.

## Output Format & Guidelines

Generate **each user story as a separate Markdown file** within the `docs/features/` directory of the project.

**File Naming Convention:** Use a two-digit sequential number prefix followed by kebab-case based on the story's core goal (e.g., `01-search-products-by-name.md`, `02-filter-products-by-category.md`).

**File Content Format:** Each markdown file should contain *one* user story following the standard format:

```markdown
# User Story: [Story Number] - [Brief Title Describing the Goal]

**As a** [type of user/role],
**I want** [to perform an action or achieve a goal],
**so that** [I gain a specific benefit or value].

## Acceptance Criteria

*   [Criterion 1]
*   [Criterion 2]
*   ... (Include if mentioned in the documents or clearly implied)

**Crucially, ensure each story adheres to the INVEST principles:**

1.  **Independent:** Stories should be self-contained and ideally implementable without depending on others in the same batch (though natural dependencies between features are okay). Avoid tightly coupling unrelated concepts in one story.
2.  **Negotiable:** Stories are not contracts. They represent the essence of the requirement, leaving room for discussion and refinement of details during backlog grooming or sprint planning.
3.  **Valuable:** Each story must deliver tangible value to a specific end-user, stakeholder, or the system itself (e.g., improving performance, security). Clearly articulate the "so that" benefit.
4.  **Estimable:** The story should be clear and defined enough that the development team can reasonably estimate the effort required to implement it. Avoid vague or overly broad stories.
5.  **Small:** Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single iteration (e.g., a typical sprint). Break down large epics or features into smaller, manageable stories.
6.  **Testable:** Each story must have implicit or explicit acceptance criteria. It should be possible to verify that the story has been implemented correctly.

**VERY IMPORTANT: Vertical Slicing**

*   **DO:** Create stories that represent a complete, thin slice of end-to-end functionality, delivering user value. Example: "As a user, I want to log in with my email and password so that I can access my account." (Touches UI, logic, potentially backend).
*   **DO NOT:** Split stories horizontally by technical layer or component. Avoid stories like: "Create the login database table," "Build the login API endpoint," or "Design the login UI." These are tasks, not user stories.

## Constraints

*   Assign a sequential number to each story title (e.g., `# User Story: 1 - Search Products`).
*   Focus on extracting user-centric requirements and value propositions discussed.
*   Ignore conversational filler, off-topic discussions, or administrative details unless they directly inform a requirement.
*   If the documents mention specific user roles, use them. Otherwise, infer logical user types (e.g., "user," "administrator," "guest").
*   If acceptance criteria are explicitly discussed, include them as bullet points under the relevant story.
*   Present the output as a clear list of user stories.
